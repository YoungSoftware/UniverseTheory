        <p>
            In the Unified Universe Theory, gravity is reinterpreted as the net result of the Temporal Force and a 
            counteracting pushback force. Traditional gravity, as described by Newton and Einstein, is an attractive 
            force that pulls objects toward each other. However, this theory suggests that gravity emerges from the 
            interaction between the Temporal Force and a resisting force that acts against the movement of mass 
            through time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The equation for gravity in this framework is:
        </p>
        <div class="math-equation">
            <span>F<sub>g</sub> = ρ / c - G * ρ * (ρ<sub>m</sub> / ρ<sub>c</sub>)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this equation, <strong>F<sub>g</sub></strong> represents the gravitational force, <strong>G</strong> is the gravitational 
            constant, <strong>ρ<sub>m</sub></strong> is the mass density of the object, and <strong>ρ<sub>c</sub></strong> is the critical 
            density of the universe. Gravity, in this view, is the difference between the Temporal Force and a 
            pushback force that depends on the mass density of the object.

        <p>
            Imagine you're holding a balloon. If you let go, the balloon starts to rise because the helium inside it is lighter than the air around it—this is like the Temporal Force pushing things forward through time. But gravity is still pulling the balloon down, so it doesn't just shoot straight up—it floats gently. Gravity in this theory is like the tug-of-war between the balloon's lift and the pull of gravity, keeping things balanced.
