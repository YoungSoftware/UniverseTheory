        <p>
            In the Unified Universe Theory, light is understood as a unique phenomenon that interacts with the fabric of spacetime in a special way. Since light has no mass, it is not subject to the same pushback forces that affect objects with mass. This lack of mass allows light to travel at the maximum possible speed through the universe—the speed of temporal expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            This concept helps explain why the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's frame of reference. Light moves at the speed of time itself, which is the speed of the universe's expansion in the fourth dimension (time). Because the pushback force for light is zero, it is pushed through the universe at this maximum speed, unaffected by the observer's velocity or position.
        </p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> Mathematical Framework</h2>
        <p>
            The relationship between light's speed, temporal expansion, and pushback force can be expressed mathematically as:
        </p>
        <div class="math-equation">
            <span>v = c = F<sub>t</sub> / m</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this equation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>v</strong> is the velocity of light, which equals <strong>c</strong>, the speed of light.</li>
            <li><strong>F<sub>t</sub></strong> is the temporal expansion force.</li>
            <li><strong>m</strong> is the mass of the object (for light, <strong>m</strong> = 0).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since the mass <strong>m</strong> of light is zero, the equation simplifies to <strong>v = c</strong>. This means that light travels at the speed of temporal expansion, which is why its speed is constant in all frames of reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, as an object's mass increases, the pushback force <strong>F<sub>p</sub></strong> becomes more significant, reducing the object's velocity through time. However, since light has no mass, it experiences no pushback force and therefore moves at the maximum speed allowed by the temporal expansion.
        </p>

        <!-- Simplified Explanation -->
        <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Simplified Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine the universe is like a racetrack where all the cars are racing through time. Most cars (objects with mass) have to deal with friction (pushback force), so they can't go as fast as they want. But light is like a supercar with no friction at all—it can go as fast as the track allows. That's why light always travels at the same speed, no matter who's watching it zoom by. The track itself is time, and light moves at the speed that time is expanding.
